## Medical Appointments Analysis

My second project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. Here, I chose the (No-show appointments dataset)[https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd2e9a_noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016/noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv&sa=D&ust=1532469042118000] for analysis.

## Dataset
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are
included in each row, for example:
 - `ScheduledDay`: tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
 - `Neighborhood`: indicates the location of the hospital.
 - `Scholarship`: indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare

## Summary of Findings
I explored the dataset by asking some questions to determine factors that are responsible for patients showing up or not for their appointments. The questions are:
  - Do patients with special ailments show up more?
  - Do younger patients show up compared to older patients?
  - If a patient recieves an sms, is he likey to show up?
  - Do females show up more than males?

After wrangling and cleaning the data, I then analyzed the data for patterns using the questions as a guide. The following summarizes my findings:
  - More patients attended their appointment regardless of special ailments, whether an SMS was recieved or not.
  - Younger ones attended their appointment more, probably because they need more care and are more prone to    sickeness due to their tender age.
  - More Females attended their appointment than males. This maybe because females are more concerned about their health than males who can be carefree most times.
